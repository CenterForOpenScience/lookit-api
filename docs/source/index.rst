Welcome to lookit-api's documentation!
==========================================

**NOTE: This documentation is a work in progress**

The `lookit-api codebase <https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/lookit-api>`_ contains the Experimenter and Lookit applications.  Experimenter is a platform for designing and administering research studies, meant for researchers. The Lookit platform is participant-facing, where users can signup and take part in studies.
It is built using Django, PostgreSQL, and Ember.js (see Ember portion of codebase, `ember-lookit-frameplayer <https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/ember-lookit-frameplayer>`_), and is developed by the `Center for Open Science <https://cos.io/>`_.
