# Celery tasks

## `build_experiment` task

The business requirements for this project included the ability for experiments to rely on versioned dependencies without causing conflicts between experiments.

The experiment application is dependent upon two separate git repos.

- `exp-addons`
- `lookit-frame-player`

Each is pinned to the **HEAD** of the **default branch** when they are previewed. Each time they are previewed this hash is updated to the current head of the default branch.

Researchers have the ability to specify a custom github url for the `exp-addons` repo. They can also specify SHAs for the commits that they would like to use for both the `exp-addons` and the `lookit-frame-player` repo. These fields are on the Build Study Page.

## What happens
The build process uses [celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/), [docker](https://www.docker.com/), [ember-cli](https://ember-cli.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), and [bower](https://bower.io/).

When a build or preview is requested a celery task is put into the build queue.

Inside the task, the study and requesting user are looked up in the database. If it's a preview task it's current state is copied into a new variable to be saved for later, then the study is put into the state of `previewing` and saved. If it's a deployment the study is put into the state of `deployment` and saved. Since these states don't actually exist in the workflow definition this short circuits the workflow engine so that studies currently undergoing deployment or preview can neither move through the workflow or be previewed or deployed concurrently.

The SHAs are checked in the study model's metadata field, if they are empty or invalid the **HEAD** of the default branch is used. This requires HTTPS calls to github for both the `exp-addons` and `lookit-frame-player` repositories.

A zip file of each repo is downloaded to a temporary directory and extracted. The `lookit-frame-player` archive is extracted in the *checkout directory* (`ember_build/checkouts/{player_sha}_{addons_sha}`). The `exp-addons` archive is extracted into `ember_build/checkouts/{player_sha}_{addons_sha}/lib/`, it acts as an ember addon.

A docker image is built based on the node:8.2.1-slim image. It is rebuilt every time because it doesn't change very often and docker rebuilds of unchanged images are very fast.

The container is started passing several environment variables. It installs python3 and several other dependencies with `apt-get`. Then it installs yarn, bower, and ember-cli@2.8 globally with npm. Next it mounts the `ember-build/checkouts` directory to `/checkouts` inside the container and the `ember-build/deployments` directory to `/deployments` inside the container. It copies `ember-build/build.sh` and `ember-build/environment` into the root (`/`) of the container and executes `/bin/bash /build.sh`.

`build.sh` copies the contents of the *checkout directory* into the container (`/checkout-dir/` inside the container) for faster file access. A couple of `sed` replacements are done where there are experiment specific data that needs to be hardcoded prior to `ember-build` running. The `environment` files are copied into the correct places. Then `yarn install --pure-lockfile` and `bower install --allow-root` are run for both `exp-addons` and `lookit-frame-player`. Once those have completed `ember-build -prod` is run to create a distributable copy of the app. The contents of the `dist` folder is then copied into the study output directory. The container is now destroyed.

Once the build process is finished the files in the `dist` folder are copied to a folder on Google Cloud Storage. If it's a preview they go into a `preview_experiments/{study.uuid}` folder in the bucket for the environment (staging or production). If it's a deployment they go into a `experiments/{study.uuid}` folder in the bucket for the environment (staging or production).

When the task is finished copying the files to Google Cloud Storage an email is sent to the study admins and organization admins.

If the task was a preview task the state of the study is set back to it's previous state. If it was a deployment the study is set to active. If the study is marked as discoverable, it will now be displayed on the lookit studies list page.

Finally, regardless of whether the task completed successfully a study log will be created. The extra field (a JSON field) will contain the logs of the image build process, the logs of the ember build process than ran inside the docker container, any raised exception, and the any logs generated by python during the entire task run. This is very helpful for debugging. Line endings are encoded for ease of storage so to read the results easily copy the contents of a study logs extra field from the admin into an editor and replace the overly escaped linebreaks `(\\\\n|\\n)` with actual line breaks `\n`. You can also use a JSON beautifier/formatter to aid readability.

## `build_zipfile_of_videos`

This task downloads videos from MIT's Amazon S3 bucket, zips them up, uploads them to Google Cloud Storage, generates a signed url good for 30m, and emails the requesting user that URL.

 - The zip filename is generated from the study uuid, a sha256 of the included filenames, and whether it's consent videos or all videos.
 - If a zip file exists on Google Cloud Storage with the same name the file is not regenerated, an email with a link is immediately sent.
 - After the task is completed all video files are immediately removed form the server. They still exist on s3 and Google Cloud Storage.

## `cleanup_builds`

This finds build directories older than a day and deletes them. It's scheduled to run every morning at 2am.

## `cleanup_docker_images`

This finds unused docker images from previous builds and deletes them. It's scheduled to run every morning at 3am.

## `cleanup_checkouts`

This finds checkout (extracted archives of github repos) directories older than a day and deletes them. It's scheduled to run every morning at 4am.
