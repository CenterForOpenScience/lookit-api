# Ember App Local Installation

This is a small Ember application that allows both researchers to preview an experiment and users to
participate in an experiment. This is meant to be used in conjunction with the [Lookit API Django project](https://github.com/lookit/lookit-api), which contains the Experimenter and Lookit applications.
The Django application will proxy to these Ember routes for previewing/participating in an experiment.
The Ember routes will fetch the appropriate models and then pass them to the exp-player component in the subrepo [exp-addons](https://github.com/lookit/exp-addons).

In order to run the frame player as it works on Lookit, you will need to additionally install the Django app `lookit-api` and then follow the local frame development instructions to make sure it communicates with the Ember app. This way, for instance, an experiment frame will be able to look up previous sessions a user has completed and use those for longitudinal designs.

> Note: These instructions are for Mac OS. Installing on another OS? Please consider
documenting the exact steps you take and submitting a PR to the lookit-api repo to update the documentation!

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* [Ember CLI](http://ember-cli.com/)
* [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

## Get a local copy of the ember-lookit-frameplayer repo

- `$ git clone https://github.com/lookit/ember-lookit-frameplayer.git`
- `$ cd lookit-api`
- `$ sh up.sh` *Installs dependencies and run migrations*
- `$ python manage.py createsuperuser` *Creates superuser locally (has all user permissions)*
- `$ touch project/settings/local.py` Create a local settings file.
- Add DEBUG = True to `local.py` and save. This is for local development only.
- `$ python manage.py runserver` *Starts up server*


## Installation

Before beginning, you will need to install Yarn, a package manager (like npm).

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/ember-lookit-frameplayer.git
 cd ember-lookit-frameplayer
 git submodule init
 git submodule update
 yarn install --pure-lockfile
 bower install

 cd lib/exp-player
 yarn install --pure-lockfile
 bower install
```

Create or open a file named '.env' in the root of the ember-lookit-frameplayer directory, 
and add the following entries to use the Pipe WebRTC-based recorder: `PIPE_ACCOUNT_HASH` 
(reference to account to send video to) and `PIPE_ENVIRONMENT` (which environment, e.g. 
staging or production). These are available upon request.

## Running / Development

* `ember serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

If you are making changes to frame definitions in `exp-addons`, you will want to use `yarn link` as described in the `exp-addons` README so your updated local code is used. If you change any dependencies, should also use yarn to update the lockfile and commit it.

### Code Generators

Make use of the many generators for code, try `ember help generate` for more details

### Running Tests

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`

### Building

* `ember build` (development)
* `ember build --environment production` (production)

### Writing documentation of frames

Documentation of individual exp-player components is automatically generated using YUIDoc:

* cd exp-player
* yarn run docs

At the moment, this is a manual process: whatever files are in the top level /docs/ folder of the master branch will be served via GitHub pages. New documentation releases will require manually making a new "release" to update the master branch, which can be done on request.
