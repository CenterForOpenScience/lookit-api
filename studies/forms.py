    # Rather than having extra (non-model) form fields for the protocol & generator, we
    # could alternately add generator, use_generator, protocol as actual model fields, and
    # use them here to construct the structure. (At that point we should really have separate
    # fields for fields & sequence too.) That would avoid awkwardly having to separate the JSON
    # into separate form fields in init, but at the expense of (a) planning on eventual
    # different models to represent protocols per study type, likely such that each study has
    # a nullable relation for lookit_runner_protocol, jspsych_runner_protocol, etc. pointing to the
    # appropriate instance if any and (b) more involved migrations. The nice thing about this
    # approach is that structure becomes an internally-used field only (for passing to
    # experiment/preview proxy) and the values to display in the form fields don't need to be recoverable
    # from it - e.g.

    # Wait - we may not need to shove everything into the structure. In that case it definitely
    # makes sense to just add fields for now; we may need to separate them out in the future.
