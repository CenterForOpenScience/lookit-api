# Lookit-api

This is the codebase for Experimenter and Lookit.  Experimenter is a platform for designing and administering research studies, meant for researchers. The Lookit platform is participant-facing, where users can signup and take part in studies. It is built using Django, PostgreSQL, and Ember.js (see Ember portion of codebase, [ ember-lookit-frameplayer](https://github.com/lookit/ember-lookit-frameplayer)), and is developed by [MIT](https://mit.edu) and [Center for Open Science](https://cos.io/).

  - `$ source envname/bin/activate` *Activates your virtual environment*
- Install postgres
  - make sure you have brew `$ brew`
  - `$ brew install postgresql`
  - `$ brew services start postgres` *Starts up postgres*
  - `$ createdb lookit` *Creates lookit database*
